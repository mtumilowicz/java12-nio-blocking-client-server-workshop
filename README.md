# project description
* please refer firstly https://github.com/mtumilowicz/java12-io-socket-client-server-workshop
    * the task is to rewrite `SingleThreadedServerAnswer` and `ClientConnectionAnswer` using NIO
* the main goal of this project is to show how to implement blocking server using java NIO
* on the workshop we will try to fix failing tests from `test/workshop` package by following steps and hints in
`java/workshop` package
* answers: `java/answers` package

# theory in a nutshell
* Java NIO - Java New IO (not Java Non-blocking IO)
* channels are a new, first-class Java I/O paradigm
* channel is a conduit that transports data efficiently between byte buffers and the entity on the other end 
of the channel
    * you can think of the buffer as a temporary storage place
    * channel can be viewed as an endpoint for communication
        * for example if we take SocketChannel class, it reads from and writes to TCP sockets
        * data must be encoded in ByteBuffer objects for reading and writing
* channel implementations vary radically between operating systems
* I/O falls into two categories: file I/O and stream I/O
    * so there are two types of channels: file and socket
* socket channels are blocking by default
* socket channels can operate in nonblocking mode and are selectable (will be discussed in details in the other 
workshops)
* a good metaphor for a channel is a
  [pneumatic tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatic_tube#In_money_transfer), 
  the type used at drive-up bank-teller windows
    * your paycheck would be the information you're sending
    * the carrier would be like a buffer
    * you fill the buffer (place your paycheck in the carrier), "write" the buffer to
    the channel (drop the carrier into the tube)
    * the payload is carried to the I/O service (bank
    teller) on the other end of the channel
    * the response would be the teller filling the buffer (placing your receipt in the carrier) and
    starting a channel transfer in the opposite direction (dropping the carrier back into the tube)
    * the carrier arrives on your end of the channel (a filled buffer is ready for you to examine)
    * you then flip the buffer (open the lid) and drain it (remove your receipt)
    * you drive away and the next object (bank customer) is ready to repeat the process using the same carrier (Buffer)
    and tube (Channel) objects
* vs io.sockets - we can get the input and output streams from the socket and use them to communcation
    * in NIO based systems, instead of writing data onto output streams
      and reading data from input streams, we read and write data from buffers
    * instead of asking for socketâ€™s input and output streams, we are going to write data to the channel itself
* `SocketChannel.socket()` - retrieves a socket associated with this channel

# conclusions in a nutshell
* `SocketChannel` - client side of the connection (~ `Socket` if blocking)
* `ServerSocketChannel` - server side of the connection (~ `ServerSocket` if blocking)
